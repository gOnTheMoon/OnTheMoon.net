This blog is dedicated to the notification server project, a well established project which many have devoted their time to its development.

I decided to start this blog for two reasons. One is an educational reason: this blog should allow one to understand the underlying concepts of the notification server project, and ultimately will allow them to write their own implementation, with the perspectives and thoughts viewed in this blog in mind.
The second reason to start this project is for reference, as I would probably forget this information in a couple of years from now.

The format I plan to use for this blog is similar to that I used for [Hatip Hayomi](https://elad.zelingher.com/tips): this means that many of the posts will be short and sometimes trivial. In the short term readers might find this annyoing, to have for instance a blog post about `ActivateAllRule`, but I believe this is what will help me keep writing. I will explain using an analogy: When you stop reading for a period of time, it is very hard to return reading, and the reading rate is very slow. What helps to ease this process is to keep reading every day, even if at a low rate, and eventually you improve. I believe the same is true for writing. Writing short posts is also relatively easier, and it will allow me to write something, even when I don't feel like it.
